# sentiment-analysis-lstm-keras
Sentiment Analysis using Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) Network. Trained using IMDB movie review dataset. Built with Keras, Tensorflow, NLTK, etc.

An LSTM network is an artificial neural network that contains LSTM units instead of, or in addition to, other network units. An LSTM unit is a recurrent network unit that excels at remembering values for either long or short durations of time. The key to this ability is that it uses no activation function within its recurrent components.

# Let's test/visualize!


Use the notebook file(main.ipynb/playground.ipynb) to play with the model. 
a webapp demo will be available soon...
Working on the Flask Webapp. Will update soon...
